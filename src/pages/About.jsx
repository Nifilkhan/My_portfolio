              <p>
                I began my career in software development as a self-taught
                developer, diving into web technologies and mastering the MEAN
                stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) on my own. My
                journey started with learning the fundamentals of web
                development and building projects to gain practical experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                I completed an internship in web development, where I gained
                hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development.
                During this time, I worked on building responsive web
                applications using Angular, managing databases with MongoDB, and
                developing APIs with Node.js and Express.js. This internship
                allowed me to collaborate with a team, solve real-world
                problems, and refine my coding skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I continued to grow, I developed several projects, including
                a dynamic weather application built using Angular and
                TypeScript, and created my personal portfolio to showcase my
                development skills. With a focus on problem-solving and a
                passion for learning, I have built a strong foundation in both
                front-end and back-end development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, I am focused on further improving my development
                skills, exploring new technologies, and seeking opportunities to
                contribute to impactful projects. I am excited for the
                opportunities ahead and the chance to continue growing in my
                software development career.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring open-source
                projects, learning new technologies, or enjoying outdoor
                activities. I believe in continuous learning and am always eager
                to take on new challenges to expand my skill set and grow as a
                developer.
              </p>
